# IJCAI2015
This repository contains the data, code and experimental results for the IJCAI2015 paper "An Iterative Approach to Synthesize Data Transformation Programs" (IPBE)

## Data
It contains two parts: (1) 30 scenarios of museum dataset (2) 10 scenarios of synthetic scenarios. For synthetic scenarios, we use special characters for column separator. 


## Code
Please unzip the IPBE.zip file.
You can import the eclipse project as a Maven project.
A sample for calling the code is edu.isi.karma.cleaning.Research.Sample.java .
It shows how to call IPBE and our implementation of Gulwani's approach.

If you want to experiment with our code, you can wrap your own logging code around our methods.

This code is only for demonstration purpose. 

## Experimental Result

The raw experimental results are in final.xlsx
